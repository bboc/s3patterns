### Agreements

We respond to drivers through agreements.

**Definition:** _A agreement is an agreed upon guideline, pattern, process or protocol designed to guide the flow of value._

    
    </script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">

* agreements are created in order to respond to drivers
* agreements are the **accountability of the circle** that created them
* each agreement includes **evaluation criteria** and is subject to **regular review**
    *  review dates are specific to each agreement
    *  agreements are reviewed in context to its driver

### Circle

A circle...

* ...is the basic building block of an organization
* ...is a group of people gathered around a driver (permanent or temporary)
* ...makes all agreements by consent
* ...is accountable for its own development

    
    </script>

### Consent Decision Making

* Consent is the absence of objections
    * everyone affected by a decision can "live with it"
    * consent is not consensus with unanimity
* Consent is used to make and evolve all agreements in a circle
* Objections stop proposals becoming agreements
* Withholding objections could harm the aims of a group or organization
* Being able to raise objections at any time means that proposals only need to be *good enough for now, safe enough to try*
* Every agreement has a review date

    
    </script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">

### Consent Decision Making...

* is a facilitated decision making process
* deliberately harvests reasoned objections in order to integrate the wisdom they contain in proposals or existing agreements
* helps balance equivalence and effectiveness
* experienced groups can move quickly through the stages of Consent Decision Making

### Driver

_A driver is that which motivates us into action: what is happening in a specific situation and what’s needed._

# Responses to a Driver #

* the response to a driver always involves the **adaptation of an existing agreement, or creation of a new one**, including:
    * changing the plan: adding a task or project
    * adaptation or creation of a role
    * creation of a new circle
        * driver review is delegated to new circle

    
    </script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">

### Drivers Are Subject to Regular Review ###

* Is the description of the situation still correct?
* Do we still associate the same needs with the situation?
* Is the driver still within our domain?
* Is the driver still relevant?

    
    </script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">

#### Value and Waste ####

_**Value** is the importance, worth or usefulness of something in responding to a driver._

**Value**:

* value is **not** an **inherent** property as it only exists in relation to a driver
* value can be quantified by **measuring the progress** of responding to driver
    * value is not necessarily expressed in currency or time
* **continuous improvement of processes is focused on optimizing the flow of value through an organization**

**Waste** _is anything not necessary for - or standing in the way of - effective response of a driver._

Adopting the concept of value and waste makes many tools and ideas from **lean production** and **lean software development** available to support organizations running on Sociocracy 3.0:

* value stream mapping
* various strategies for eliminating waste
* the Kanban Method

    
    </script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">

#### Waste and Continuous Improvement ####

* Establishing a process for ongoing elimination of waste enables natural evolution of an organization towards greater effectiveness
* Adaptation to changing environment is built into the process

    
    </script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">

#### Identifying Waste ####

![](img/workflow-and-value/drivers-value-waste.png)

* waste exist in many different forms and on different levels of abstraction
    * tasks, processes, organizational structure, mental models...
* some tensions reveal waste
* learning to identify waste is a journey
    * along the way we also learn how to evolve our drivers

### Objections

_An **objection** is an importan reason why doing what is proposed stands in the way of (more) effective response toan existing driver._

In sociocracy we deliberately seek objections as they potentially reveal information that can be used to improve proposals and agreements.

    
    </script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">

Objections...

* ...reveal wisdom seeking expression into the consciousness of a circle
* ...reveal opportunities or impediments
* ...emerge through individuals and belong to the whole circle

    
    </script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">

### Questions That Help to Validate Objections ###

* Does the objection relate to this specific proposal or agreement?
* Does this objection reveal how a (proposed or existing) **agreement**...

    * ...jeopardizes the response to a driver?
    * ...is in conflict with the organization's values?
    * ...prevents or diminishes someone's contribution to responding to a driver?
    * ...can be improved significantly?

    
    </script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">

# Concerns... #

* ...are not objections
* ...are not important enough to prevent an agreement
* ...often contain wisdom
* ...can be recorded in the logbook
    * ...to further evolve agreements
    * ...to set evaluation criteria (including review date)

### Proposal Forming

Proposal Forming...

* ...is similar to condensed design thinking process
* ...taps the collective intelligence of a group
* ...involves people in co-creating agreements
* ...fosters accountability and a sense of ownership

    </script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">

### Proposal Forming Process ###

1. **Identify** the driver
2. **Consider**: Collect considerations as questions that reveal the scope of the issue
3. **Create**: Gather ingredients/ideas for solutions
4. **Refine**: Design a proposal from some or all of the ingredients
5. **Review**: process with consent decision making

### Qualifying Drivers

** ...in order to avoid action bias**

>_Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom._ (Viktor E. Frankl)

We consider why, how and when to respond to a stimulus, instead of defaulting to action.

### Resolve Objections

# Methods for Resolving Objections #

* ask proposal owner
* ask member with objection to amend proposal
* facilitator amends proposal
* "How would you solve this" – round
* Brief Dialogue – 2 or 3 people
* Brief group discussion
* refer to proposal forming
* drop the proposal
* Re-work – Send back to higher / lower circle
* Form a temporary circle to review, research, revise

### Navigating Via Tension

* individuals act as sensors for the organization
* tension is experienced whenever our perception of our environment is in conflict with:
    * that which we desire or had anticipated
    * our values (and principles)
* problems, challenges, and feelings of unease are all tensions

### From Tension to Driver ###

* investigating tension leads to the discovery of drivers
* to identify a possible driver behind a tension we:
    * **describe** the situation
    * **identify** the needs we associate with that reality
* in the process, we resolve some tensions as **misunderstandings**
* we validate drivers
    * some tensions are **outside the domain** we can address

### Rounds

A group facilitation technique to maintain equivalence.

1. Pick a random person to start
    * begin with a different person each time to maintain equivalence
2. Go around the circle, give everyone the chance to speak

There's  a number of ways that experienced groups can fast track certain rounds.

# Organizational Structure

The primary function of organizational structure is **to enable effective collaboration** by aligning the flow of information to  support the flow of value..

**Organizational structure needs to evolve continuously** in order to adapt to a changing environment.

**Semi-autonomous, self-organizing and self-governing circles** are the basic building blocks for organizational structure.

### Structural Patterns ###

* Sociocracy 3.0 describes a variety of patterns to grow organizational structure
* patterns apply to different layers of abstraction (basic, micro, macro and meta)
* different patterns serve different drivers
* patterns can be combined as needed
* more patterns are out there and will be discovered

### Agree On Values

**Definition:** *A value is a principle of some significance that guides behavior.*

* In an organization people come together to collaborate
* every individual has values that are influenced by their experiences and beliefs
* values may define ethical limitations to action

![](img/collaboration-values/values-step2.png)

* organizational values **define culture** and set parameters for action
* values offer guidance to determine appropriate action, even in the absence of explicit agreements
* a group or organization may **choose to collectively adopt values**
* defining values is a **strategy** that supports effectiveness of an organization:
    * reduces potential for **misunderstanding**
    * **aligns** decision making and action
    * **attracts new members, partners and customers** who are aligned with the organization
* values are an agreement, and thus subject to **regular reviews**

### Transparent Salary

* transparent salaries need to be fair
* fairness has several orthogonal dimensions
* perception of fairness is specific to organization
* consider members and relevant stakeholders (e.g. investors)
* classic sociocracy: everyone feels gains and losses
* consider remuneration for changing roles
* create strategy for transitioning towards new contracts and compensation agreements
