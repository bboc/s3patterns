title: Open Systems

An organization is not a closed system, it is an open network with many connections to the "outside".

Keep the system open by adding connections as temporary or permanent members in decision making and experiments:

* external experts: benefit from outside perspective and knowledge
* representatives of affected parties: integrate existing relationships ([Those Affected Decide](those-affected-decide.md))
